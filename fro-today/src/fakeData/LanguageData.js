It employs a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into small, self-contained units called components, each responsible for rendering a specific part of the user interface. React.js utilizes a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the UI by only re-rendering components that have changed, resulting in improved performance and responsiveness. One of React's key features is its declarative nature, allowing developers to describe how the UI should look at any given time, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match this description.",
